Description: The tRNA package allows information of tRNA to be accessed and 
    subset based on these features. In addition, it provides visualization tools
    to compare multiple tRNA sets and correlate them to additional data. The 
    tRNA package uses GRanges objects to work with, so any custom additions can 
    be easily added.
