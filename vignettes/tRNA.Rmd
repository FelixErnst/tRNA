# Introduction

The `tRNA` package provides access to tRNA feature information for subsetting
and visualization. Visualization functions are implemented to compare feature
parameters of multiple tRNA sets and to correlate them to additional data.

As input the package expects a `GRanges` object with certain metadata columns.
The following columns are required: `tRNA_length`, `tRNA_type`,
`tRNA_anticodon`, `tRNA_seq`, `tRNA_str`, `tRNA_CCA.end`. The `tRNA_str` column
must contain a valid dot bracket annotation. For more details please have a look
at the vignette of the `Structstrings` package.

# Loading tRNA information

To work with the `tRNA` package, tRNA information can be retrieved or loaded 
into a R session in a number of ways:

  1. A `GRanges` object can be constructed manually containing the required 
  colums mentioned above.
  2. a tRNAscan result file can be loaded using the function
  `import.tRNAscanAsGRanges()` from the `tRNAscanImport` package
  3. selected tRNA information can be retrieved using the function
  `import.tRNAdb()` from the `tRNAdbImport` package

For the examples in this vignette a number of predefined `GRanges` objects are 
loaded.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tRNA)
  library(Structstrings)
})
data("gr", package = "tRNA", envir = environment())
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tRNA)
library(Structstrings)
data("gr", package = "tRNA", envir = environment())
```

# tRNA sequences and structures

To retrieve the sequences for individual tRNA structure elements the functions
`gettRNAstructureGRanges` or `gettRNAstructureSeqs` can be used. Several
optional arguments can be used to modify the result (See 
`?gettRNAstructureSeqs`).

```{r}
# just get the coordinates of the anticodonloop
gettRNAstructureGRanges(gr, structure = "anticodonLoop")
gettRNAstructureSeqs(gr, joinFeatures = TRUE, structure = "anticodonLoop")
```

In addition, the sequences can be returned already joined to get a fully blank
padded set of sequences. The boundaries of the individual structures is returned
as metadata of the `RNAStringSet` object.

```{r}
seqs <- gettRNAstructureSeqs(gr[1L:10L], joinCompletely = TRUE)
seqs
# getting the tRNA structure boundaries
metadata(seqs)[["tRNA_structures"]]
```

Be aware, that `gettRNAstructureGRanges` and `gettRNAstructureSeqs` might not be
working as expected, if the tRNA sequences in questions are armless or deviate
drastically from the canonical tRNA model. The functions in the `tRNA` packages
were thouroughly tested using human mitochondrial tRNA and other tRNAs missing
certain features. However, for fringe cases results may differ. If you encounter
such a case, please report it with an example.

# Subsetting tRNA sequences

Structure information of the tRNA can be queried for subsetting using several
functions. For the following examples the functions `hasAccpeptorStem` and 
`hasDloop` are used.

```{r echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
gr[hasAcceptorStem(gr, unpaired = TRUE)]
# mismatches and bulged are subsets of unpaired
gr[hasAcceptorStem(gr, mismatches = TRUE)]
gr[hasAcceptorStem(gr, bulged = TRUE)]
# combination of different structure parameters
gr[hasAcceptorStem(gr, mismatches = TRUE) & 
     hasDloop(gr, length = 8L)]
```

Please have a look at the man page `?hasAccpeptorStem` for all available 
subsetting functions.

# Visualization

To get an overview of tRNA features and compare different datasets, the function
`gettRNAFeaturePlots` is used. It accepts a named `GRangesList` as input.
Internally it will calculate a list of features values based on the functions
mentioned above and the data contained in the mcols of the `GRanges` objects.

```{r}
# load tRNA data for E. coli and H. sapiens
data("gr_eco", package = "tRNA", envir = environment())
data("gr_human", package = "tRNA", envir = environment())

# get summary plots
grl <- GRangesList(Sce = gr,
                   Hsa = gr_human,
                   Eco = gr_eco)
plots <- gettRNAFeaturePlots(grl)
```
```{r plot1, fig.cap = "tRNA length."}
plots$length
```
```{r plot2, fig.cap = "tRNAscan-SE scores."}
plots$tRNAscan_score
```
```{r plot3, fig.cap = "tRNA GC content."}
plots$gc
```
```{r plot4, fig.cap = "tRNAs with introns."}
plots$tRNAscan_intron
```
```{r plot5, fig.cap = "Length of the variable loop."}
plots$variableLoop_length
```

To access the results without generating plots, use the function 
`gettRNASummary`.

To check whether features correlate with additional scores, optional arguments
can be added to `gettRNAFeaturePlots` or used from the `score` column of the
`GRanges` objects. For the first case a list of scores with the same dimensions
as the `GRangesList` object has to be provided as the argument `scores`. For the
latter case, just set the argument `plotScore = TRUE`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# score column will be used
plots <- gettRNAFeaturePlots(grl, plotScores = TRUE)
```
```{r}
plots <- gettRNAFeaturePlots(grl,
                             scores = list(runif(length(grl[[1L]]),0L,100L),
                                           runif(length(grl[[2L]]),0L,100L),
                                           runif(length(grl[[3L]]),0L,100L)))
```
```{r plot6, fig.cap = "tRNA length and score correlation."}
plots$length
```
```{r plot7, fig.cap = "variable loop length and score correlation."}
plots$variableLoop_length
```

Since all plots returned by the functions mentioned above are `ggplot2` objects,
they can be modified manually and changed to suit your needs.

```{r plot8, fig.cap = "Customized plot switching out the point and violin plot into a boxplot."}
plots$length$layers <- plots$length$layers[c(-1L,-2L)]
plots$length + ggplot2::geom_boxplot()
```

In addition, the data of the plots can be accessed directly.

```{r}
head(plots$length$data)
```

# Options

The colours of the plots can be customized directly on creation with the 
following options.

```{r}
options("tRNA_colour_palette")
options("tRNA_colour_yes")
options("tRNA_colour_no")
```

# Dot bracket annotation

To retrieve detailed information on the base pairing the function
`gettRNABasePairing()` is used. Internally this will construct a
`DotBracketStringSet` from the `tRNA_str` column, if this column does not
already contain a `DotBracketStringSet`. It is then passed on to the
`Structstrings::getBasePairing` function.

A valid DotBracket annotation is expected to contain only pairs of `<>{}[]()`
and the `.` character (Please note the orientation. For `<>` the orientation is
variable, since the tRNAscan files use the `><` annotation by default. However
upon creation of a `DotBracketStringSet` this annotation will be converted).

```{r}
head(gettRNABasePairing(gr)[[1L]])
head(getBasePairing(gr[1L]$tRNA_str)[[1L]])
```

The loop ids for the structure elements can be retrieved with the
`gettRNALoopIDs()` function, which relies on the `Structstrings::getLoopIndices`
function. (For more details, please have a look at the `?getLoopIndices`)

```{r}
gettRNALoopIDs(gr)[[1L]]
getLoopIndices(gr[1L]$tRNA_str)
```

# Session info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
