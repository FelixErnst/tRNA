Description: 
    The tRNA package allows tRNA sequences and structures to be accessed and 
    used for subsetting. In addition, it provides visualization tools
    to compare feature parameters of multiple tRNA sets and correlate them to 
    additional data. The tRNA package uses GRanges objects as inputs requiring 
    only few additional column data sets.
